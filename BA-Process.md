# Overview of the hiring process
## Phone Screens
#### Technical phone screen
You'll be writing some code in a collaborative editing environment (https://coderpad.io/) which allows one or two of our team members to evaluate your technical skills.

## Onsite Interviews
#### Whiteboard Feature Requirements
You’ll be solving one or more different business problems by architecting solutions on a whiteboard.

#### Process Review
Our goal is to understand the depth and breadth of experiences you’ve had as an engineer. We’ll look to understand the types of roles you’ve led, the teams you've worked with and your experience with project management, QA and BA's.  

#### Resumé Review
This interview focuses on your background, the places you’ve worked, the teams you’ve been part of, and the impact you’ve had. We’re interested in learning the story of how you arrived at where you are in your career and understanding the key experiences and opportunities that have shaped you in the process.

#### Closing
This interview is your time to ask any final questions you might have about Prologis and to provide feedback about your experiences during the day.

# What you should expect at onsite interviews
A brief introduction to Prologis.

Each interview will last approximately 45-­60 minutes and many will give you a chance to ask questions about Prologis or the role. These interviews will cover a number of technical and cultural assessments as described above.

A 30-minute chat with a Prologis team member, this is not a part of the interview process and is not included in the evaluation. It provides you an opportunity to learn more about Prologis by asking questions about our products, culture, what it’s like to work at Prologis, etc.

# During the whiteboard interviews
We’re interested in how you approach the problem, how you communicate with an audience and how you take an idea through to delivery.

Our questions will typically start simple enough, but often leave room to explore interesting challenges. Real world challenges are often nuanced or subtle, and solutions to them often have second­order effects. Parts of our interview process are designed to explore these types of scenarios with you. You might be asked to solve a question multiple times with a variety of different constraints. Most of the problems will have a variety of different answers ranging from a naive solution to some much too complex to fit on a whiteboard. An optimal answer would be great, but we’re also interested in how you approach the problem – your thought process.
