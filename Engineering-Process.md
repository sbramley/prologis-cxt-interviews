# Overview of the hiring process
## Phone Screens
#### Technical phone screen
You'll be writing some code in a collaborative editing environment (https://coderpad.io/) which allows one or two of our team members to evaluate your technical skills.

## Homework
#### Technical project
You will be provided with a technical challenge to solve, the challenge will be specific to the engineering role you're looking to fill.

The technical challenges are available in the following location:
* https://github.com/sbramley/technical-challenges

## Onsite Interviews
#### Whiteboard Problem Solving
You’ll be solving one or more different technical problems by architecting solutions on a whiteboard.

#### Project Presentation
This is your opportunity to present your coding homework project to the team, the focus of this presentation is to gather your comfort level in talking through code and design and field questions from team members as to the implementation technique.

#### Resumé Review
This interview focuses on your background, the places you’ve worked, the teams you’ve been part of, and the impact you’ve had. We’re interested in learning the story of how you arrived at where you are in your career and understanding the key experiences and opportunities that have shaped you in the process.

#### Process Review
Our goal is to understand the depth and breadth of experiences you’ve had as an engineer. We’ll look to understand the types of roles you’ve led, the teams you've worked with and your experience with project management, QA and BA's.  

#### Closing
This interview is your time to ask any final questions you might have about Prologis and to provide feedback about your experiences during the day.

# What you should expect at onsite interviews
A brief introduction to Prologis.

Each interview will last approximately 45-­60 minutes and many will give you a chance to ask questions about Prologis or the role. These interviews will cover a number of technical and cultural assessments as described above.

A 30-minute chat with a Prologis engineer, this is not a part of the interview process and is not included in the evaluation. It provides you an opportunity to learn more about D&B by asking questions about our products, engineering culture, what it’s like to work at D&B, etc.

# During the whiteboard interviews
We’re interested in how you approach the problem, our team specialise in Solutions engineering. Think out loud and ask questions.

Our questions will typically start simple enough, but often leave room to explore interesting challenges. Real world challenges are often nuanced or subtle, and solutions to them often have second­order effects. Parts of our interview process are designed to explore these types of scenarios with you. You might be asked to solve a question multiple times with a variety of different constraints. Most of the problems will have a variety of different answers ranging from a naive solution to some much too complex to fit on a whiteboard. An optimal answer would be great, but we’re also interested in how you approach the problem – your thought process.

# How to prepare for your on-site interview
Review Computer Science fundamentals including basic algorithms and data structures. Understand how a variety of data structures work and why you’d use one over another. Brush up on Big O notation and be able to perform time and space complexity analysis. Practice writing code, especially if you’re out of practice. Focus on your strongest language. Practice getting comfortable with writing real code on a whiteboard or a piece of paper. Avoid pseudo­code; we want to see syntactically correct code in whichever language you choose to code.

Solve a few problems on HackerRank, so that you can become familiar with the environment we use for some of our interviews. Review your resume and recall specific stories you may want to share. Determine the projects you have been a part of that best exemplify your skills, accomplishments, abilities, and approach towards business. Have a plan for the mock interview. Know what role you are planning to interview for. Plan the questions you will ask.
